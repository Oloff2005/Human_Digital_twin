"""Stream utilities for inter-unit communication.

This module defines a simple :class:`Stream` class that represents a
uni-directional connection between two unit operations.  Each stream
can buffer payloads that are pushed into it and releases them after a
configurable delay.  The design is intentionally lightweight so that
unit tests can run without heavy dependencies.
